# Shopify GPT-3 Challenge

## Overview

My app allows users to send plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list. Users can select the GPT-3 model they want to use. Button is disabled when there is no text. When page renders the cursor is focused on the input to allow users to begin typing. Users can copy the AI's response to the clipboard with a simple button. I wish I would of known about this challenge earlier to implement more. Added localStorage that allows users to see previous responses.
